# Community-Translator-Bot

https://t.me/CommunityTranslatorBot -- is a bot, which will be creating and changing on your eys with your help. 

Our roadmap is a perspective.

**Firstly**: We're going to remake https://t.me/Sytranslatorbot (it was my first translator bot) from telebot to aiogram and add some new features

**Secondly**: This bot will be not just as translator. It will be also like your vocabluary where you can save words with translation and then check your memory.

**Thirdly**: I'm sure that this bot needs Mini App in telegram, so developers in REACT JS, JS, TS, HTML and CSS - i'm waiting for you! 

**Fourthly**: It's going to be absolutely free bot

**Fifthly**: All developing procees you'll se on youtube channel https://youtube.com/channel/UCfQNxzN5rChqfvqEZMveE-w
